<h1>Bike Sales Dashboard - Excel</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data. Using Excel, I meticulously cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates, expanding abbreviations, and transforming variables for better visualization. The developed dashboard offers an interactive exploration of correlations between bike sales and crucial factors like gender, age range, and commute distance. By studying these relationships, the dashboard aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing sales strategies and understanding customer behavior.
